# coxKM (cox Kernel Machine)

coxKM (cox Kernel Machine) is an R package for conducting SNP-set association tests for right-censored survival outcomes based on a kernel machine cox regression framework. coxKM is meant for common genetic variants only. coxKM tests for association between a SNP-set (made up of common variants) and a right-censored survival outcome.
